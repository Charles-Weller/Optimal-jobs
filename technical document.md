## Analysis
### The problem:
The problem which I have identified and will be solving is a gap in the job finding market as there is no easy way to look for zero-hour contracts. (A zero-hour contract is a type of employment contract between an employer and an employee whereby the employer is not obliged to provide any minimum number of working hours to the employee). Currently in the UK there are 32.6 million people employed and only 3.1% are seen to be zero-hour contracts. This is surprising to me as for students it is a much better option then permanent employment. It allows the student to take a few weeks off during exams and more difficult periods of schooling. The student will also not lose their contract with their place of employment. Additionally, it allows the student to adapt their work timetable week by week to better suit their current situation. 

I will be solving this problem with university students as the intended user, as, while talking to other students, I have become aware of the difficulty of holding jobs during stressful times of the year. This is due to the minimum expected hours (part of a work contract that states the minimum house an employee must work a week). The application will be made with students in mind; the application will be easy and fast to use so that less of the day is spent finding employment. This can be achieved by a large range of functions and all required functions being available in on place. 

This will make it easy for both sides of the job sector to use as it will allow an employer to have many applicants and job listings up at once. The easy application process and searching for the job would be beneficial for employers as well, as roles could be filled within a short time frame. 

### Current solutions to the problem:
#### Recruitment Agencies:
Recruitment agencies are organizations which match employers to employees. This can be seen as private and public sectors allowing anyone to have access to these services.

Pro | Con
-|-
Large level of connection and partnered companies. | Can take a while.
Specialist helps with the finding of a job. | Not prioritized.
Job places may be open to agencies before the positions are opened to public. | Pressure to take jobs you don’t want.
Access to more job openings. | Competition with other candidates.
Employer vetting is done for you. | Not all recruiters may understand your industry.
Career guidance. | Commission driven relationship.
&nbsp; | 40,000 in the UK, with 1782 in London alone; there is a great level of competition.

#### Online job finder websites: 
Online job finders are websites which can be used by employers to help display open positions in a company. There are also websites where people can include their experience and employers can look to find people to fill their roles (which is less common as large company will use head-hunters more often than not).

Pro | Con
-|-
Large range of areas. |	Can be complicated to use. 
Ability to search for a small area. |	User may not be sure what “what” means on the opening page.
CV builder (not a function of all websites).	| User will not be sure what keyword is related to in search.
Will take less time than other choices to use. |	Would be catered for everyone trying to find a job.
Filter options. |	Large amount of competition.
&nbsp; |	Everyone on the website will be able to see the same thing you do; it may be hard to be chosen. 

#### Education support job finders:
Education support can be seen throughout education but is most commonly seen in university. These are schemes/plans which help students to find jobs, better their financial situation, and help build wider skills.

Pro	| Con
-|-
Will be for the exact level of the student.	| May take a while.
School shares a large range of connection with companies.	| May require an extension in your number of university years.
Companies prefer students from school as they know they will be well educated and fond of the subject. |	Will not be able to find small jobs, such as those which run off zero-hour contracts, as schools are seen to find internships and apprenticeships (usually 3, 6, 12 months).
&nbsp; | Low competition.	
	

When I create the application, I will be taking all the pros and cons of previous efforts at solving this problem into consideration. For example, a filter option so that certain jobs could be searched for. I will produce the user interface in a way which is easy and efficient to use. Unfortunately, due to a restriction in time, a range of the pros in existing solution will not be able to be matched, such as the benefit of a CV maker which would be found on a website and having relations with companies. 

### Interviews:
I have chosen to interview three students, asking them the questions stated below and condensing their answers. The three students are all in different stages of their university education, with one first year, third year and a postgraduate. 

#### The students were asked the following questions:
1.	Why do you not have a job?
   
The students stated that jobs are hard to find in a close proximity to their location which would work around school hours. Additionally, any job which a student would manage to find would put pressure on them at the end of the year during exam season. This would lead to students having to use all their holidays or quit jobs entirely, as they would not be able to focus on both or complete the required hours.

2.	How are you trying to find your new employment?

The students have been finding jobs online using websites, social media posts, and asking shops about any possible positions. There was a complaint from a student that the time it takes to find a job is too long and leads to a drop in living standards, as savings are needed to pay for vital resources. 

3.	Why do you think you are having no success?

The students believe that, due to an extensive range of competition with online applicants, businesses would neglect students. This is because of their inability to work constantly, as it would be better to have a full-time employee than a part-time employee who would need a month off for exams, creating stress for other staff members.

4.	What would make you use this application?

The students would prefer this application as it is easier to use and can find jobs in a smaller amount of time than counter parts. Also, there is the ability to apply to a large range of job at once.

5.	What makes a good application for you?

The students believe a good application is based on results, ease of use, and if it can cover a large range of functions so they don’t need to use several websites at once.

6.	 Do you belive it is important to be able to save your data externally?

All studance expressed great interest in the ability to save data externally, as it would allow the data to be accessed then the devise is offline and allows easy sharing of data. 

7.	What is the key function you would like to see?
    
The students voiced interest in a large main display to see multiply job at once, pages made in an easy-to-use fashion (easy to understand thew the uses of labels and easy to find all function), and a filter option to help specify jobs which are available in their location (in local postcode such as in SW11). 

### Project summary: 
This application will be made with students in mind and is aimed to make it easy for them to find a job. This would be done by making the code easy to use and using pros from different existing solution, then bringing them together to allow a single application for all the benefits of other ways to find a job. 

After looking into current solutions to the problem and talking to the targeted user of the application, I have decided to use a range of functions and information the user will have access to. 

Firstly, I have decided to use two tree view to display information to the user. There will be one large main tree view which will display the current open job listings with information on the jobs, ranging from the company name to the location where the employer would expect the user to work. A secondary tree view will also be used; unlike the main tree view, the data in the secondary tree view will be changed based on user interaction. This will allow the user to be able to display their favourited jobs and, if a user has a job listing up, will offer employees the option to view the details of the applicant. 

Next, the creation of the button to allow the user to access different pages and use inbuilt functions. There will be a button created to allow the user to open the Upload job page, create or delete a job listing which they have made. A user will be able to favourite and apply to a job listing, and display the user favourited position (on the secondary tree). They can also save the application of the user’s job listing to an external file, and a filter function will allow the user to filter through the job listing which they have on the main page.  

Then, due to the large level if interest in the ability to save data externally by the studance. I have decided to create a methord in the application which allow a user to save the applicants of their job listings on an external file. The idea of the ability for a user’s to save their favourites (users favourited job listings) was looked at. But as job listings can be taken down at every time and would not affect any external files meaning a studant way be using an outdated job list causing then to be missed leaded about the avalible job listings. 

Next, the ability of admin access was seen to be a necessary addition to the application as the ability for a user to be able to create any job listings they want could lead to impersonation or inappropriate jobs listings being created. The admin account would be able to delete any job listings no mater if they made it or not allowing the ability for moderation of the server. 

Finally, the creation of the database to allow the user to save their favourites, account, job listing, and applications will have to be made to allow the user to have all the needed information without making the application too complicated.
