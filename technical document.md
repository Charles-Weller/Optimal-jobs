## Analysis
### The problem:
The problem which I have identified and will be solving is a gap in the job finding market as there is no easy way to look for zero-hour contracts. (A zero-hour contract is a type of employment contract between an employer and an employee whereby the employer is not obliged to provide any minimum number of working hours to the employee). Currently in the UK there are 32.6 million people employed and only 3.1% are seen to be zero-hour contracts. This is surprising to me as for students it is a much better option then permanent employment. It allows the student to take a few weeks off during exams and more difficult periods of schooling. The student will also not lose their contract with their place of employment. Additionally, it allows the student to adapt their work timetable week by week to better suit their current situation. 

I will be solving this problem with university students as the intended user, as, while talking to other students, I have become aware of the difficulty of holding jobs during stressful times of the year. This is due to the minimum expected hours (part of a work contract that states the minimum house an employee must work a week). The application will be made with students in mind; the application will be easy and fast to use so that less of the day is spent finding employment. This can be achieved by a large range of functions and all required functions being available in on place. 

This will make it easy for both sides of the job sector to use as it will allow an employer to have many applicants and job listings up at once. The easy application process and searching for the job would be beneficial for employers as well, as roles could be filled within a short time frame. 

### Current solutions to the problem:
#### Recruitment Agencies:
Recruitment agencies are organizations which match employers to employees. This can be seen as private and public sectors allowing anyone to have access to these services.
