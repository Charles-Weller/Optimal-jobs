## Analysis
### The problem:
The problem which I have identified and will be solving is a gap in the job finding market as there is no easy way to look for zero-hour contracts. (A zero-hour contract is a type of employment contract between an employer and an employee whereby the employer is not obliged to provide any minimum number of working hours to the employee). Currently in the UK there are 32.6 million people employed and only 3.1% are seen to be zero-hour contracts. This is surprising to me as for students it is a much better option then permanent employment. It allows the student to take a few weeks off during exams and more difficult periods of schooling. The student will also not lose their contract with their place of employment. Additionally, it allows the student to adapt their work timetable week by week to better suit their current situation. 

I will be solving this problem with university students as the intended user, as, while talking to other students, I have become aware of the difficulty of holding jobs during stressful times of the year. This is due to the minimum expected hours (part of a work contract that states the minimum house an employee must work a week). The application will be made with students in mind; the application will be easy and fast to use so that less of the day is spent finding employment. This can be achieved by a large range of functions and all required functions being available in on place. 

This will make it easy for both sides of the job sector to use as it will allow an employer to have many applicants and job listings up at once. The easy application process and searching for the job would be beneficial for employers as well, as roles could be filled within a short time frame. 

### Current solutions to the problem:
#### Recruitment Agencies:
Recruitment agencies are organizations which match employers to employees. This can be seen as private and public sectors allowing anyone to have access to these services.

Pro | Con
-|-
Large level of connection and partnered companies. | Can take a while.
Specialist helps with the finding of a job. | Not prioritized.
Job places may be open to agencies before the positions are opened to public. | Pressure to take jobs you don’t want.
Access to more job openings. | Competition with other candidates.
Employer vetting is done for you. | Not all recruiters may understand your industry.
Career guidance. | Commission driven relationship.
&nbsp; | 40,000 in the UK, with 1782 in London alone; there is a great level of competition.

#### Online job finder websites: 
Online job finders are websites which can be used by employers to help display open positions in a company. There are also websites where people can include their experience and employers can look to find people to fill their roles (which is less common as large company will use head-hunters more often than not).

Pro | Con
-|-
Large range of areas. |	Can be complicated to use. 
Ability to search for a small area. |	User may not be sure what “what” means on the opening page.
CV builder (not a function of all websites).	| User will not be sure what keyword is related to in search.
Will take less time than other choices to use. |	Would be catered for everyone trying to find a job.
Filter options. |	Large amount of competition.
&nbsp; |	Everyone on the website will be able to see the same thing you do; it may be hard to be chosen. 

#### Education support job finders:
Education support can be seen throughout education but is most commonly seen in university. These are schemes/plans which help students to find jobs, better their financial situation, and help build wider skills.

Pro	| Con
-|-
Will be for the exact level of the student.	| May take a while.
School shares a large range of connection with companies.	| May require an extension in your number of university years.
Companies prefer students from school as they know they will be well educated and fond of the subject. |	Will not be able to find small jobs, such as those which run off zero-hour contracts, as schools are seen to find internships and apprenticeships (usually 3, 6, 12 months).
&nbsp; | Low competition.	
	

When I create the application, I will be taking all the pros and cons of previous efforts at solving this problem into consideration. For example, a filter option so that certain jobs could be searched for. I will produce the user interface in a way which is easy and efficient to use. Unfortunately, due to a restriction in time, a range of the pros in existing solution will not be able to be matched, such as the benefit of a CV maker which would be found on a website and having relations with companies. 

### Interviews:
I have chosen to interview three students, asking them the questions stated below and condensing their answers. The three students are all in different stages of their university education, with one first year, third year and a postgraduate. 

#### The students were asked the following questions:
1.	Why do you not have a job?
   
The students stated that jobs are hard to find in a close proximity to their location which would work around school hours. Additionally, any job which a student would manage to find would put pressure on them at the end of the year during exam season. This would lead to students having to use all their holidays or quit jobs entirely, as they would not be able to focus on both or complete the required hours.

2.	How are you trying to find your new employment?

The students have been finding jobs online using websites, social media posts, and asking shops about any possible positions. There was a complaint from a student that the time it takes to find a job is too long and leads to a drop in living standards, as savings are needed to pay for vital resources. 

3.	Why do you think you are having no success?

The students believe that, due to an extensive range of competition with online applicants, businesses would neglect students. This is because of their inability to work constantly, as it would be better to have a full-time employee than a part-time employee who would need a month off for exams, creating stress for other staff members.

4.	What would make you use this application?

The students would prefer this application as it is easier to use and can find jobs in a smaller amount of time than counter parts. Also, there is the ability to apply to a large range of job at once.

5.	What makes a good application for you?

The students believe a good application is based on results, ease of use, and if it can cover a large range of functions so they don’t need to use several websites at once.

6.	 Do you belive it is important to be able to save your data externally?

All studance expressed great interest in the ability to save data externally, as it would allow the data to be accessed then the devise is offline and allows easy sharing of data. 

7.	What is the key function you would like to see?
    
The students voiced interest in a large main display to see multiply job at once, pages made in an easy-to-use fashion (easy to understand thew the uses of labels and easy to find all function), and a filter option to help specify jobs which are available in their location (in local postcode such as in SW11). 

### Project summary: 
This application will be made with students in mind and is aimed to make it easy for them to find a job. This would be done by making the code easy to use and using pros from different existing solution, then bringing them together to allow a single application for all the benefits of other ways to find a job. 

After looking into current solutions to the problem and talking to the targeted user of the application, I have decided to use a range of functions and information the user will have access to. 

Firstly, I have decided to use two tree view to display information to the user. There will be one large main tree view which will display the current open job listings with information on the jobs, ranging from the company name to the location where the employer would expect the user to work. A secondary tree view will also be used; unlike the main tree view, the data in the secondary tree view will be changed based on user interaction. This will allow the user to be able to display their favourited jobs and, if a user has a job listing up, will offer employees the option to view the details of the applicant. 

Next, the creation of the button to allow the user to access different pages and use inbuilt functions. There will be a button created to allow the user to open the Upload job page, create or delete a job listing which they have made. A user will be able to favourite and apply to a job listing, and display the user favourited position (on the secondary tree). They can also save the application of the user’s job listing to an external file, and a filter function will allow the user to filter through the job listing which they have on the main page.  

Then, due to the large level if interest in the ability to save data externally by the studance. I have decided to create a methord in the application which allow a user to save the applicants of their job listings on an external file. The idea of the ability for a user’s to save their favourites (users favourited job listings) was looked at. But as job listings can be taken down at every time and would not affect any external files meaning a studant way be using an outdated job list causing then to be missed leaded about the avalible job listings. 

Next, the ability of admin access was seen to be a necessary addition to the application as the ability for a user to be able to create any job listings they want could lead to impersonation or inappropriate jobs listings being created. The admin account would be able to delete any job listings no mater if they made it or not allowing the ability for moderation of the server. 

Finally, the creation of the database to allow the user to save their favourites, account, job listing, and applications will have to be made to allow the user to have all the needed information without making the application too complicated. 

### Potential technical solution:
#### Website-based application:
A possible solution would be through the creation of a client-based website. This would allow users to access this service from any part of the world. In addition to this, the website would use a server that contains all user and job details. The page would use a user key and a UserID, containing all user data. This would be accessed once logged in. 

##### Advantages
Creating a website-based application would have personal benefits related to gaining knowledge and understanding of coding a website in HTML or JavaScript. It also has the potential to become a functional business. The website would run though a server, so the processing time would be much quicker than if all the data was being processed by local devices. It would also allow a much larger amount of data to be held in the database, increasing the possible number of users and jobs available. Furthermore, the process of distributing this service would be much simpler and faster than having to send user code and the database though a service, such as email.

##### Disadvantages
A website-based application would have a large range of expenses related to it, as a domain and server would need to be purchased. In addition to this, the maintenance crew needed to maintain the servers daily would lead to extra cost in wages. Moreover, the complexity needed to write the level of code in HTML would be extremely demanding and unrealistic without a large amount of code being found on the internet. On top of this, the continuous debugging would be frustrating.

#### Procedural Programming:
Another possible solution to this problem would be creating the application in Python, using functions. These procedures would gather user input, such as the username and password. It would output data to the user, such as eligible jobs through print statement, on to a Python IDEL shell. The program would be built using subroutines to carry out procedures. Examples of this would be procedures allowing the user to log in and create an account. They would then gather data, which the user may use, but would not have any form of GUI (Graphical user interface) or interactive option past entering values. 

##### Advantages 
Creating a solution using Procedural Programming would have a range of benefits related to the time and complexity of the programming. This can be seen because the code will be simple to write as it is linear. It would therefore not take any learning or further research to create the necessary code. The complexity of the code means it would take up less memory than other methods. 

##### Disadvantages 
Procedural Programming can be seen as being better suited for the processing of data than looking after data. This makes Procedural Programming an unsuitable solution to the problem, as there is a large amount of data which needs to be processed, so it may not be updated in real time. Another disadvantage is that a procedural language does not use abstraction to modularise the code. This would mean that it is difficult to add new data types or function without going back to previous sections of the code and modifying them. 

#### Object orientated programming:
The final possible solution which is taken into consideration for the creation of the application is Object Orientated Programming (OOP). This is a programming model that organises software design around data and objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined using classes that have unique attributes and behaviour. As the code is written in this way, it allows data to be affected without impacting other functions of the program and to run sections of the code using instantiation of the classes. Additionally, the code which relates to sections of the running codes can be split up to increase the efficiency. This is due to the fact that the code being run is only related to the correct function of the code. There are 4 main functions of OOP: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

##### Advantage
As code would be created in the form of objects, it can be reused and recalled at any time. The code running constantly increases efficiency and decreases the size of the code helping with the distribution of the application. Methods and attributes can be hidden, which would stop a user or programmer from changing essential sections of the code, as this would lead to unwanted outputs in the code. Code is also easier to add to and change due to all section of the code being modularised. This also helps with error checking, as they can be limited to small sections of code.

##### Disadvantage
Object Orientated programs are much larger files in comparison to their counterparts, such as procedural competitors. This is due to the increase in complexity and detail on GUI and code. This leads to the complete solution being much larger than other solutions requiring more time and energy to code and run. 

#### Chosen solution: 
Taking the advantages and disadvantages of a website-based application into consideration, I believe it would be in my best interest to use a different solution to the problem. This is due to the time needed to learn a web-based coding language, and because the running of a server, even if run from my laptop, would not be suitable for coursework of this scale.

The possibility of the final solution being made with a mobile app has been taken into consideration but is seen to have the same advantage and disadvantages as a website. On one hand, it would have the possibility to send notifications to the user, which is seen to be a great advantage over all other possible solutions and would be the only one with the ability to do this. However, even taking this into consideration, the disadvantage outweighs the pros of making the final solution with a mobile app. 

Considering the advantages and disadvantages of creating the final solution using Procedural Programming, I believe it would be a suitable solution, but it would not allow the depth or detail desired to put into the code. Therefore, it would not be functional if I decided to take this project further. Consequently, I will not be using it to create this application.

Taking the advantages and disadvantages into account, I have chosen to use Object Orientated Programming for my final solution. The reason for this is the advantages related to code, which can be made using objects and methods. These will allow me to divide my programme into parts, which will indicate the different Tkinter windows in my code. This will lead to debugging being a lot easier and the source code being more logically structured, allowing for easy identification of sections of code. The next best option for my final solution would be Procedural Programming. However, it would not allow me to create a GUI, while Object Oriented Programming does. As classes in the code would represent each window, I used composition and instantiation to link them together. This is because it will allow the code to affect variables, and classes would not be running. Also, through the use of composition, windows can be run so that when the last window is closed, the new window remains running. Therefore, if instantiation is used to call the class it may also be destroyed when the container class gets destroyed. 

A GUI will make the working environment for the user. This is cleaner, and it removes some of the difficulty around the use of the application. This will be done through Tkinter in the Python interface, a GUI library. I decided to use Tkinter because it will allow me to easily programme the interfaces and use different widgets that the library offers, such as entry boxes, labels, frames, etc.

I will also be using SQL light, to store details and data in a database. SQL allows the subsets of information within a database to be selected, deleted, added to, or altered. It can also be used to add data to the database (which would be used when creating an account). For example, when a new account is made, details would be added to the database and functions like autoincrementing would be used to add UserID. I would need to create several tables which, through SQL, can be easily linked and can help sections of the code run smoothly.

I will be using encryption in my application to increase security and allow user data to be safer. After researching the security and difficulty factors of different method of encryption, I decided on a form of Caesar Cipher.

### Limitations:
Limitations can be seen in to be present in two major areas knowledge, and hardware.

Hardware causes a limitation in the creation and functionality of the application. This is down to the current location of the database being local to the user, even though that application is in a complete state. When a job is listed it will only affect the local database. This would lead to it not being displayed to any user outside of the device which the listing has been created.

This problem could be easily solved with a central server which holds the database, allowing every user to have access to all listings created by other users, no matter the geological distance. 

Knowledge will lead to limitation in the quality of the application but, unlike hardware limitations, I will be able to overcome this limitation with a range of research into methods and inbuilt functions to help with the creation and increase the efficiency of the application. (Research I completed can be found in Research under the design section.)
